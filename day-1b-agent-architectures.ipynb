Now, you'll learn how to scale up by building **agent teams**.\n\nJust like a team of people, you can create specialized agents that collaborate to solve complex problems. This is called a **multi-agent system**, and it's one of the most powerful concepts in AI agent development.\n\nIn this notebook, you'll:\n\n- ✅ Learn when to use multi-agent systems in [Agent Development Kit (ADK)](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/)\n- ✅ Build your first system using an LLM as a \"manager\"\n- ✅ Learn three core workflow patterns (Sequential, Parallel, and Loop) to coordinate your agent teams\n\n## ‼️ Please Read\n\n> ❌ **ℹ️ Note: No submission required!**\n> This notebook is for your hands-on practice and learning only.

Imagine a software development process where tasks are intelligently broken down, delegated, and where your applications can even learn from their own actions. This is the exciting future offered by Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), a transformative paradigm that empowers developers to build more robust, adaptable, and intelligent applications than ever before.\n\nAt its core, MAS revolutionizes software development by decomposing intricate problems into smaller, more manageable sub-problems, each assigned to a dedicated agent. This approach fosters enhanced modularity, leading to cleaner codebases and significantly simplifying the debugging process. You can create specialized agents, each an expert in a specific function, which promotes code reuse and allows your development teams to concentrate on their core strengths. Critically, this decentralized control architecture offers a substantial increase in resilience; should one agent encounter an issue, others can often compensate or adapt, preventing a catastrophic system failure.\n\nBeyond structural improvements, MAS provides unparalleled adaptability. Agents are designed to react dynamically to changing environments and unforeseen events in real-time, making your software inherently more agile and responsive. Furthermore, complex, emergent behaviors can naturally arise from the interactions of simple agents, paving the way for truly innovative solutions. MAS also presents a natural and powerful framework for integrating machine learning, enabling your agents to learn from data and continuously improve their performance over time.\n\nMAS also fundamentally streamlines collaboration and resource management within your development projects.

What if the first draft of our story is bad?

Does his hand tremble as he touches the map? Does his breath catch in his throat? Does he lean closer, his eyes wide with wonder and perhaps a touch of fear? More visceral reactions will draw the reader deeper into his experience.\n2.  **Elaborate on the \"Unknown Energy\":** You mention the salt spray tasted \"different, charged with an unknown energy.\" This is a great sensory detail, but it could be expanded. How did this energy manifest *before* the map was found? Was it just a feeling, or were there subtler signs Elias, as the lighthouse keeper, might have noticed (e.g., unusual currents, strange lights on the water, a peculiar silence)? This could foreshadow the map's arrival.\nRefinerAgent > Elias, keeper of the Widow’s Wail, polished the great lens, its beam a familiar caress against the inky sea. Tonight, however, the salt spray tasted different, charged with an unknown energy that made the fine hairs on his arms prickle. A strange, almost imperceptible hum vibrated through the stone tower, and the gulls, usually raucous, had fallen into an unnerving silence. Descending to his small study, the air thick with the scent of brine and something wild, he found it—a rolled parchment, tucked beneath his worn logbook. It wasn’t paper, but something like dried kelp, and it pulsed with a soft, aquamarine light.\n\nElias’s breath hitched. His hand, usually steady from years of maintaining the lamp, trembled as he reached for the object. It felt cool, almost alive, beneath his fingertips. Unfurling it, he gasped, his eyes widening. A map, but not of any coast he knew. Islands like scattered jewels, marked with symbols that danced and shifted, glowed against the dark material. A single, larger island, shaped like a coiled serpent, shimmered brightest, a faint, melodic hum emanating from its luminous contours. He leaned closer, his heart pounding a frantic rhythm against his ribs, a mix of wonder and a primal fear coiling in his gut. The sea outside roared, a familiar sound that now seemed distant, muted. Elias, utterly captivated, felt a new, uncharted tide pulling him, a siren song from the heart of the glowing sea.\nCriticAgent > Your revised story is excellent! It successfully incorporates the suggestions for improvement, creating a more immersive and atmospheric experience.\n\nHere's a breakdown of what works well:\n\n*   **Character:** Elias's internal experience and physical reactions are much more palpable. The detail about his \"usually steady\" hand trembling adds significant weight to his discovery.\n*   **Plot:** The pacing is strong. The build-up of the strange atmosphere and Elias's discovery of the map are well-balanced, leading to a compelling climax of wonder and fear.\n*   **Pacing:** The pacing is effective. The story starts with a subtle shift in atmosphere, building tension towards the reveal of the map.
