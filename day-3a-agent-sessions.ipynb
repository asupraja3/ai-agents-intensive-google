Drug discovery is one of the most exciting and rapidly advancing areas of AI in healthcare. There have been significant new developments and continued progress in recent times. Here are some of the key areas and recent trends:\n\n**1. AI-Powered Target Identification and Validation:**\n\n*   **Uncovering Novel Drug Targets:** AI algorithms are analyzing vast biological datasets (genomic, proteomic, transcriptomic) to identify novel disease pathways and potential protein targets that were previously unknown or difficult to discover through traditional methods.\n*   **Predicting Target \"Druggability\":** AI can help assess whether a newly identified target is likely to be responsive to drug intervention, saving resources on pursuing unpromising avenues.\n*   **Understanding Disease Mechanisms:** AI is helping researchers gain deeper insights into the complex biological mechanisms underlying diseases, leading to the identification of more precise and effective drug targets.\n\n**2. Accelerating Molecule Design and Synthesis:**\n\n*   **Generative AI for Novel Molecules:** This is a major breakthrough.

Accelerating Molecule Design and Synthesis**\n\nThis area is particularly transformative because it addresses a core bottleneck in drug discovery: the creation of entirely new chemical entities that can interact with disease targets. Here's a deeper dive into what this entails:\n\n**What is Molecule Design and Synthesis in Drug Discovery?**\n\n*   **Molecule Design:** This is the process of creating the chemical structure of a potential drug. Traditionally, this involved chemists using their knowledge and intuition to design molecules, or screening vast libraries of existing compounds to find ones that might work.\n*   **Synthesis:** Once a molecule is designed, it needs to be chemically synthesized in a lab to be tested. This can be a complex and time-consuming process.\n\n**How AI is Revolutionizing This Area:**\n\nAI, especially **Generative AI**, is fundamentally changing how we approach molecule design and synthesis.\n\n**A. Generative AI for Novel Molecules:**\n\n*   **The Concept:** Generative AI models are trained on massive datasets of existing molecules and their properties. They learn the underlying rules of chemistry and molecular structure. Once trained, they can then *generate* entirely new molecular structures that have never been seen before.\n*   **How it Works (Simplified):** Imagine showing a child millions of pictures of cats and dogs. Eventually, they can start drawing their own unique cats and dogs. Generative AI does something similar with molecules.\n    *   **Models Used:** Common architectures include:\n        *   **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):** Two neural networks compete – one generates molecules, and the other tries to distinguish between real and generated molecules. This competition drives the generator to create increasingly realistic and valid molecules.\n        *   **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs):** These models learn a compressed representation (a \"latent space\") of molecular structures and can then decode points from this space back into novel molecules.\n        *   **Transformer Models (similar to those used in language):** These are increasingly being adapted to process molecular sequences (like SMILES strings) and generate new ones.\n*   **Key Advantages:**\n    *   **Novelty:** AI can explore chemical space far beyond what human intuition or existing libraries can cover, leading to truly novel drug candidates.\n    *   **Targeted Design:** Generative models can be \"conditioned\" to produce molecules with specific desired properties (e.g., high binding affinity to a particular protein, good solubility, low predicted toxicity). This is often referred to as **\"de novo\" drug design** (designing from scratch).\n    *   **Efficiency:** AI can generate thousands or millions of candidate molecules in a fraction of the time it would take a human chemist.\n\n**B. Optimizing Existing Molecules:**\n\n*   AI can also take an existing, promising molecule and suggest modifications to improve its characteristics. This is like taking a good sketch and refining it to make it even better.\n*   For example, if a molecule binds well to its target but is poorly absorbed, AI can suggest chemical changes that might improve absorption without significantly compromising its binding.\n\n**C. Predicting Synthesis Pathways:**\n\n*   **The Challenge:** Designing a molecule is one thing; making it in the lab is another. Some designs might be chemically impossible or incredibly difficult to synthesize.\n*   **AI's Role:** AI models can be trained on retrosynthesis databases (information about how chemicals are made) to predict viable and efficient routes for synthesizing a newly designed molecule. This bridges the gap between design and actual laboratory work.\n*   **Benefits:**\n    *   **Feasibility Check:** Quickly determine if a designed molecule is synthesizable.\n    *   **Efficiency:** Identify the shortest and most cost-effective synthesis routes.\n    *   **Automation:** Potentially automate parts of the synthesis planning process.\n\n**Impact and Significance:**\n\nThis development is crucial because:\n\n*   **Breaks Through \"Challenging\" Targets:** For diseases where finding effective drugs has been difficult, AI's ability to generate novel chemical structures can open up new possibilities.\n*   **Reduces Time and Cost:** By automating and accelerating design and initial synthesis planning, AI significantly shortens the early stages of drug discovery, which are often the most time-consuming and expensive.\n*   **Increases the Likelihood of Success:** By designing molecules with better predicted properties from the outset, AI can lead to candidates that are more likely to succeed in later stages of development.\n\nThis combination of generative design and synthesis prediction is rapidly becoming a cornerstone of modern pharmaceutical research and development.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about the key players in the AI-driven molecule design and synthesis space.

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer.

This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
